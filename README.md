Hey bro, I have finsihed the todo application. 

For what I want you to do for the application it is really simple - 

I want you to just rename everything, that is it. Just rename the classes and files and folders etc. so that it is no longer a Todo app, but it is the journalling app that you were telling me about. 
It will still function as the ToDo app, but I just want the naming convention to be for our journalling app and I will let you decide the naming convention that is appropriate.

This is the link of the YouTube tutorial that helped me make the application. It is a direct 1 to 1 copy. 
However, some of his U.I features are out of date, so I changed the screens U.I with some more modern Android features, it wasn't too much as you will see in his finished version and my version.
Hope that helped, keep me updated I will check the ReadMe :)
